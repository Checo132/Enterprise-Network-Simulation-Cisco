# üñß Enterprise Network Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project is a practical simulation of a secure enterprise network designed in Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates how core cybersecurity principles like network segmentation, firewall layering, DMZ implementation, and routing/NAT security are applied in a real-world scenario.

The network includes 3 user PCs, a database server, layered internal and external firewalls, a router, and a simulated internet connection (cloud). It highlights architectural flaws such as lack of segmentation and redundancy, while also suggesting improvements like VLANs, HSRP, Syslog integration, and port-level ACLs.

Ideal for beginners exploring Blue Team network defense, SOC design, or prepping for Cisco security certs.

## Observed Weaknesses

- No VLAN segmentation (flat Layer 2 design)
- No redundancy‚Äîsingle points of failure
- No logging/monitoring system
- Incomplete NAT/routing logic

---

## Suggested Improvements

- Implement VLANs (users, servers, management)
- Add HSRP or redundant firewalls
- Introduce dynamic routing (OSPF or EIGRP)
- Enable logging via Syslog or NetFlow
- Enforce tighter firewall ACLs
- DMZ isolation + port security

---

##  What I Learned

- The importance of firewall placement
- Why segmentation and monitoring matter
- How routing decisions impact security zones
- Layered defense in enterprise architecture
